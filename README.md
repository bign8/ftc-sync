# ftc-sync

Sync Source code to FTC Robotics running OnBotJava.

## Background

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Android studio, and I enjoy reverse engineering a frontend, so... why not build a CLI to sync files on a hose system with an FTC Robot.

My goal here is to improve the dev loop by allowing pushing code over wifi to an FTC robot.

Still a WIP, but PRs are welcome!
